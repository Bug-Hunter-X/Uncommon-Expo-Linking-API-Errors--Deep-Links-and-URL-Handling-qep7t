# Uncommon Expo Linking API Errors: Deep Links and URL Handling

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors that can occur when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links. The examples showcase situations where the app might not register the deep link URL correctly, or might fail to open the correct URL when a link is tapped.  The provided solutions offer ways to troubleshoot and fix these issues.

## Common Causes and Solutions:

* **Incorrect URL Scheme:** Ensure your app's URL scheme in `app.json` matches the one in your deep links.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Properly handle `Linking.getInitialURL()` using `.then` or `async/await`.
* **Background Handling:** Implement background URL handling for complete functionality.
* **Permissions:** Verify Android permissions for handling URLs.
* **App State:** Ensure the app is ready to process URLs before handling events.
* **Conflicting Libraries:** Check for conflicts with other libraries using URL handling.
* **Incorrect URL Encoding:** Use `encodeURIComponent` for special characters.
* **Testing:** Test from supported contexts and verify app registration.
