This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links. The app might not register the deep link URL correctly or might fail to open the correct URL when a link is tapped.  The following code demonstrates this, along with some common causes:

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

Linking.addEventListener('url', (event) => {
  console.log('URL received:', event.url);
  // Handle the URL here
});

Linking.getInitialURL().then(url => {
  if (url) {
    console.log('Initial URL:', url);
    // Handle the initial URL
  }
});
```

**Causes:**

* **Incorrect URL scheme:**  Make sure your app's URL scheme is correctly configured in your `app.json` and that it matches the scheme used in your deep links.
* **Missing or incorrect `Linking.makeUrl` usage:** If constructing URLs programmatically, ensure you use `Linking.makeUrl` correctly to build properly formatted URLs.
* **Asynchronous operations:** Remember that `Linking.getInitialURL()` is asynchronous and might not return immediately. Handle it using `.then` or `async/await`.
* **Background handling:** Make sure your app handles URL events even when it's in the background. Expo's background handling capabilities might require extra configuration.
* **Permissions:**  On Android, ensure your app has the necessary permissions to handle URLs.
* **App's state:**  Incorrect state management within the app, such as the app not being ready to handle a URL when it's received, could lead to failure.  Ensure the relevant URL processing logic is available when the app is ready to handle these events.
* **Conflicting libraries:**  Conflicts with other libraries that use the same URL handling mechanisms might disrupt Expo's Linking API.
* **Incorrect URL encoding:** Incorrectly encoded characters in the URL could cause parsing errors.   Consider using `encodeURIComponent` for problematic characters.
* **Testing:** When testing, make sure that your app is correctly registered with the relevant system for handling links, and that the links are being tapped from a supported context (e.g., not within the emulator's browser).
